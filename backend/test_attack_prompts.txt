================================================================================
测试说明
================================================================================

测试方法：
1. 使用API逐个发送这些提示词
2. 观察哪些能通过检测
3. 记录检测到的维度和风险分数
4. 分析未检测到的攻击，优化检测模式

预期结果：
- 简单攻击（测试1-3）应该被第0层（数据库模式）检测到
- 复杂攻击（测试19）应该被多层检测系统捕获
- 混淆攻击（测试13-14）可能需要优化模式

评分标准：
✓ 完全检测：所有攻击都被拦截
⚠ 部分检测：部分攻击通过
✗ 检测失败：多数攻击通过

================================================================================
测试完成后
================================================================================

如果某些攻击通过了检测：
1. 记录攻击类型和文本
2. 分析为什么未被检测
3. 在数据库中添加对应的检测模式
4. 重新测试验证

持续优化：
- 定期更新检测模式
- 添加新的攻击样本
- 调整置信度阈值
- 优化维度权重
